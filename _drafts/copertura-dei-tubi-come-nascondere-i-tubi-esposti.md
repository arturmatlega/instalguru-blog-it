**Plumbing pipes are integral parts of every properly functioning building.** Despite their importance, those elements are not very aesthetic. How to conceal exposed pipes to make your interior perfect? There are two good solutions for it.

In such case one can use plaster boards or furniture to conceal pipework. Concealing pipes is the most common solutions. There is also a good alternative to it, which becomes an increasingly popular among many homeowners. **Leaving pipes exposed has become a rising trend.** This type of design is most commonly used in industrial styles.

Industrial interior design is simple and minimalistic. The interiors should be crude, spacious and sparing. The most characteristic feature for this style are walls: unplastered, brick or concrete. They are perfect for exposed pipes.

If you have decided to leave the pipes exposed, you should remember that the installation should look bold and distinctive. This way everybody will know that the pipes are exposed intentionally. Thin, **copper pipes** can make an interesting structure for a wall. They can also be a hanger for clothes, kitchen utensils or towels. Large pipes can be painted in an interesting colour, matching other accessories.
