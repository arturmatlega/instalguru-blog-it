## Why does your sink smell?

There are many causes for a smelly sink. On of the most common reasons is improper installation or incorrect drain connection. Those are only two possibilities. Other causes involve too extreme exploitation of the system or contrary - its sporadic use. A clogged drain might be the reason for sink odour. Another one is **faulty ventilation**. Depending on the gravity of the issue, an adequate solution should be implemented. Home remedies usually resolve the problem, but sometimes they are not enough.

## Fixing a clogged drain

A sink is central point in every bathroom. It is used many times throughout a day. If the sink is not regularly cleaned, it might result in a **clogged drain**. A similar situation might occur in case some residues, e.g. from shaving get into the drain. Does such situation require calling a specialist or perhaps you can fix it yourself? Contrary to what you might think, it is not a difficult task. There are many home remedies to unclog the drain.

**Important** One of the easiest methods involves using baking soda, vinegar and boiling water. Just pour a glass of baking soda into the drain and pour boiling water over it. After 15 minutes add another glass of soda and a glass of vinegar. The mixture will start to fizz up. Pour more boiling water after another 15 minutes.

Both of the above methods can be used from time to time as a prevention, for instance once in a month. This will surely reduce the risk of clogging your sink and prevent the smell from occurring.

## What if nothing works?

It is possible that despite using all the presented methods the problem of smelly sink still persists. What to do in such case? **How to remove an odour from sink?**

The most likely cause of it is a faulty plumbing ventilation system. The water is probably sucked out from drains which causes the smell in the sink. The only solution for that is calling a specialist and possibly reconstruction of the system. This will remove the smell from the sink permanently.

A well designed plumbing **ventilation system** contributes to the comfort of using sanitary appliances. Modifying the installation at the stage of construction is no problem at all. It is much more difficult when the building is already finished. It might generate additional costs. Of course a building with a faulty plumbing ventilation can be inhabited, however the unpleasant smell might be troublesome.
